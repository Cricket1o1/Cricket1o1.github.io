    <h2> <a href=" https://www.espn.com
"target="_blank"> Least favorite </a></h2>
    <h4> ESPN </h4>
    <p> ESPN's website I would rank as one of my least favorites due to the way it's cluttered. It has modern design that helps sports fans find information. It has very good HTML code with some codes that I could pick up on and some codes that I've never seen before.The navigation is very helpful but can seem cluttered at times, it may not feel as user friendly for some. The color scheme of black, white, and red creates a striking look, though it might not appeal to everyone. The site has real time updates and high quality visuals, which makes engagement good. The overall experience can feel cluttered at times. While it serves its purpose well for sports news and scores, it may not be the most enjoyable site for all users due to the fact of it not being organized well enough and articles popping up all over and trying to find past articles can be hard. The website's layout often shows more new content, which can overshadow older articles and important features. This  can be good for real time sports news but may frustrate users looking for in depth analysis or historical data. The large picture on the homepage makes the page cluttered and hard to navigate. While the site does offer useful tools, like personalized content recommendations and a search function, these features can get lost in the clutter, making it hard for readers to be able to find content that they want to read even if the scrolling is smooth.

    <h2> <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/"target="_blank"> Best sports website </a></h2>
     
        <h4> Bleacher Report </h4>
    <p> Bleacher Reportâ€™s website  is one of my favorite sports websites because it offers an experience for sports fans that's exciting, the HTML code is clean and has a well structured layout for its articles, videos, and trending topics in a 3 column grid. The  website doesn't use many tables. While navigation is very easy, with a clear menu highlighting key topics to choose, there is a lot of content that can make the site feel overwhelming. The scrolling is smooth and it loads very fast. The color of the website is good as it makes the articles pop out and effectively engage the people reading and reflecting on the excitement around the content.  The issue with the website is that it has a very cluttered part when it tries to fit in all its articles. They do a better job that espn does tho. It has unique features that gets the audience to interact with the app and makes it fit what they want to see and that makes Bleacher Report better than other sports websites.

    <h3>  <a href=https://www.si.com/
target="_blank"> 2nd Best Website </a></h3>
      <h4> Sports Illustrated </h4>
    <p> </p>
      <h3>Sports Illustrated's website presents a very modern design.  This design effectively makes its readers be able to find the information they want to find fast and easy. The site has very good HTML code and uses elements like header, nav,main, and footer, there is code that I was easy to pick up on fast that we have been learning about and some code that I didn't notice.The layout features a balanced combination of articles, images, and videos organized in a grid format, allowing for easy navigation across various sports categories. While the navigation menu is very easy to navigate,  It shows trending stories and many different sections that hold a lot of information. The color of reds, whites, and blacks that creates an appearance similar to espn.The difference between the two sites is the organization of the articles. The colors make it feel sporty and get people's attention in different articles. The site shows features such as the visuals are very good,  the white space makes the content easy for readers to read. I believe that sports illustrated was able to put their ways of having a good magazine layout into a website that is easy for its readers to go through and interact with.
