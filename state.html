      <h4>Kansas </h4>
    <p> Kansas state website has a simple design with a mix of blue and white colors. While it’s functional,some people might find it less appealing to the eye compared to other state websites that ive looked at. The layout is simple, but it can feel a bit bland and might not stand out as much as others. It still offerssections and links to find information about the state and the type of services they provide.</p>
